#  SQL Project — Job Market Data Analysis

##  Introduction
This project explores job market trends using SQL to analyze data on job postings, salaries, and in-demand skills.  
The goal is to identify the top-paying jobs, the most in-demand skills, and insights into optimal skill combinations for data-related roles.

---

##  Background
With the growing demand for data professionals, understanding which skills drive higher salaries and job opportunities is essential.  
This project focuses on **Data Analyst** roles to uncover insights such as:
- What skills are most requested by employers?  
- Which skills are associated with the highest salaries?  
- How do remote and non-remote job opportunities compare?

The data was provided in CSV format and loaded into a PostgreSQL database for analysis.

---

##  Tools Used
- **PostgreSQL** — database management and querying  
- **SQL** — for data extraction, transformation, and analysis  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** — as the development environment  
- **CSV files** — as raw data input sources  

---

##  Analysis Conducted
The project is organized into SQL scripts across two main folders:

###  `sql_load/`
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `1_create_database.sql` | Create the database and schema |
| `2_create_tables.sql` | Define table structures and relationships |
| `3_modify_tables.sql` | Clean and modify data for analysis |

###  `project_sql/`
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `1_top_paying_jobs.sql` | Identify highest-paying job titles |
| `2_top_paying_job_skills.sql` | Find skills linked to high-paying jobs |
| `3_top_demanded_skills.sql` | Rank skills by demand in job postings |
| `4_top_paying_skills.sql` | Analyze average salary by skill |
| `5_optimal_skills.sql` | Combine demand and salary data to find the most valuable skills |

Each script uses **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**, **aggregations**, and **joins** to extract actionable insights from the dataset.

##  What I Learned
- How to **design and structure a SQL project** for real-world data analysis  
- Writing efficient SQL queries using **joins**, **CTEs**, and **aggregate functions**  
- Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using SQL  
- Translating business questions into SQL logic to generate insights  
- Understanding the relationship between **skills demand** and **average salary** in the data job market  

---

##  Conclusions
- **SQL, Python, and Excel** consistently appear as top-demand skills for Data Analyst roles  
- Technical skills like **Python** and **SQL** correlate with higher salaries  
- Remote data analyst jobs often offer competitive pay compared to on-site roles  
- Combining **high-demand** and **high-paying** skills provides the best career advantage
